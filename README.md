# Constructor-Hangman

## Description
This is a Hangman command-line game using constructor functions as well as leveraging npm packages to interact with user.  

Three constructor functions were created:  
*RandomWord: Used to generate a random word from a word array.  
*Word: Used to create an object representing the current word the user is attempting to guess.  
*Letter: Used for each letter in the current word. Each letter either displays an underlying character or a blank underscore, depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter.  
*Inquirer npm was used for user's input.  

## Game Overview
A random word will be automatically generated at the start of the game.
Player will have X guesses to guess the word based on the length of the word.
If player guesses correctly, the letter will show on the terminal. Otherwise, it will continue to be hidden and player will lose one live.
If player runs out of lives and not completed the word or player completed the word correctly, the round will be over.
Player will have a chance to play again or leave the game.
